It&#39;s served us well for the last 18 months or so but its time to move on to the next level and make the website a hub for all - existing members and new visitors.

We will be taking over the offices of One Black Bear in the Custard Factory for a whole day, planning tasks first thing in the morning, coding and designing through the day for a relaunch on the Monday morning (we need to test these enhancements, hence the delay in launching).

If you&#39;re keen to attend, bring your kit (laptop or Mac) and some drink - we&#39;ll supply some munchies and try to fit in a pub lunch at some point." start_date="2007-11-10" end_date="" start_time="10:00:00" end_time="20:00:00" personal="0" selfpromotion="0" metro_id="1867" venue_id="92886" user_id="20974" category_id="4" url="http://www.multipack.co.uk/" date_posted="2007-09-24" latitude="" longitude="" geocoding_precision="" geocoding_ambiguous="" venue_name="One Black Bear" venue_address="405 The Custard Factory, Gibb Street" venue_city="Birmingham" venue_state_name="Birmingham" venue_state_code="bham" venue_state_id="768" venue_country_name="United Kingdom" venue_country_code="uk" venue_country_id="6" venue_zip="B9 4AA" venue_url="http://www.oneblackbear.com" venue_phone="0121 288 2296" />
