		<title>After Dark Film Festival</title>
		<link>/company/trevor-morris/2007/10/24/after-dark-film-festival/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.torontoafterdark.com">Toronto After Dark Film Festival</a> showcases thrilling international cinema,
and runs annually during the week before Halloween.</p>

<p>The frightening film festival features a diverse selection of feature film premieres and innovative short films in the
genre of horror, sci-fi, and fantasy.</p>

<p>Last year there was the JHorror film Reincarnation � going on the standard from last year, this years films should be
good as well. If you&#8217;re a horror fan you should definitely pick them up on DVD when they&#8217;re released.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I do not live anywhere near Toronto else I would have definitely attended.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> is a photo sharing website, based around a great community. The basic idea is

<p>There is a great community spirit around Flickr and it&#8217;s great to browse the huge range of photos and participate
in their comments. There are groups you can join for a whole host of differing topics � enough to suit anyone (and
more!).</p>

<p>You can restrict your photos for friends and family, tag them for easy grouping, put them in sets and those within groups
and even add the geo-location information. The data associated with your photos is huge and all available using
Flickr&#8217;s brilliant API.</p>

<p>I implore you to <a href="http://flickr.com/explore/">explore</a> all the <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/" title="Most interesting photos from the last 7 days...">interesting

		<title>Last.fm</title>
		<link>/company/trevor-morris/2007/10/15/lastfm/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> is &#8220;the social music revolution&#8221;. Simply listen to music on your
computer or iPod and Last.fm will save your playlists. Every song you listen to will become part of your music profile.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve uploaded a few tracks, you can start enjoying all the features, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically create personal music charts and radio station.</li>
<li>Discover, explore and listen to new music.</li>
<li>See what your friends are listening to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because Last.fm is a passive social website, all you need to do is create an account and listen to your music. The main
idea of the website is to record your listening habits, but there is also a nice social aspect to the website. You can
engage with users who listen to similar music and browse for new music based on your taste and listening habits of
others.</p>

		<title>Top Gear &#39;till Christmas!</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/10/08/top-gear-till-christmas/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Getting the kids to bed without breaching the 8 o&#8217;clock deadline has become ever more stressful with the return of
Clarkson, Hammond and the polite one with sympathetic hair in BBC2&#8217;s Top Gear - Sunday 8pm.</p>

<p>While there are still oil reserves man will endeavour to construct evermore creative ways of depleting supplies all in
the name of entertainment. In episode one we see Lamborghini, Porsche, Aston Martin and Volkswagen none the less, doing
their utmost to raise sea levels - fantastic!</p>

<p>Bit worrying to think I&#8217;ll be Christmas wrapping before the series ends in December.</p>

		<title>Top Gear is Back!</title>
		<link>/company/trevor-morris/2007/10/04/top-gear-is-back/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/">Top Gear</a>, everyone&#8217;s favourite petrol-fueled TV show, is back on the BBC
this Sunday (7th October). Hang out with Clarkson, Hammond and Captain Slow for a ten-week run of the best car show on
earth.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll be trans-country challenges (hopefully), stupidly expensive super-cars, celebrities in a reasonably priced
car, the Stig racing around the track and no doubt plenty of non-PC jokes, especially about the Germans.</p>

<p>Tune in at <strong>8pm on Sundays</strong> or catch the repeats on Wednesdays at 7pm.</p>

		<title>Living Legend</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/10/03/living-legend/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>They say you can judge a man by his friends - well having a friend like Dave is a sure-fire way of dragging your average
score up. My longest standing mate from 4th year Geography, and some 25 years on we will be celebrating his 39th Birthday
this weekend. This guy is real Swiss Army Knife of a friend - he even a bloody good cook, God damn it!</p>

<p>Of course just knowing a legend doesn&#8217;t make you one yourself - I&#8217;ve got a long way to go but as long as
Martin, Leigh, Rich and Dave don&#8217;t turn into mass murders I think I&#8217;ve got this sewn up.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday dude!</p>

<p>P.S. Alison says <em>&#8220;every super hero has his nemesis - Superman has Kryptonite, Ian&#8217;s is a vacuum
cleaner.&#8221;</em></p>

		<title>Great North Run</title>
		<link>/company/leigh-scott/2007/10/03/great-north-run/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Well, my Brother and I did it! 13.1 miles of the Great North Run in 2 hours and 20 minutes. A bit slower than we would
have liked, but what an experience. </p>

<p>Emotions ran high throughout the run and we both enjoyed the atmosphere and the company of all the other runners. </p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who kindly sponsored us, we raised almost �800 for the NSPCC. </p>

<p>I would also like to congratulate all those special people out there who completed the run and raised money for other
good causes. Well done everyone!</p>

		<title>Nokia N95</title>
		<link>/company/trevor-morris/2007/09/21/nokia-n95/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I finally upgraded my mobile phone to a <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n95/index.html">Nokia N95</a>.</p>

<p>This is now my fifth Nokia in a row. I have progressed many iterations including one with a qwerty keyboard (6800), a
6600 and the phone I&#8217;ve just replaced is a 6680. Each time the phone has functioned extremely well and I&#8217;ve
never had one break (yet).</p>

<p>It has an amazing amount of features including Wi-Fi, a five mega-pixel camera and GPS. I&#8217;m really looking forward
to using all the data and creating a web interface to browse the information. Stay tuned�</p>

		<title>Run, Fatboy, Run</title>
		<link>/company/trevor-morris/2007/09/13/run-fatboy-run/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>David Schwimmer is at the helm in his theatrical directorial d�but, <a href="http://www.runfatboyrunmovie.com">Run,
Fatboy, Run</a>: a story of love and perseverance but with a heavy twist of humour. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Dennis,
the hapless protagonist yearning after his ex-fianc�e, who he left pregnant at the altar five years ago! Now a washed-up,
unfit (but not fat) security guard for a lingerie store, he is trying to win back the respect of his son and the love of his
life.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Simon Pegg and David Schwimmer have collaborated. They starred alongside one another in
the overlooked heist-gone-wrong comedy of confusion and betrayal, Big Nothing. I highly recommend both <a
href="http://www.bignothing.co.uk">Big Nothing</a> and Run, Fatboy, Run if you&#8217;re a fan of British humour and
sarcasm.</p>
