		<title type="text">Our Web Packages &#38; SEO</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a <a href="/services/websites/" title="Check out our Website Packages">new website</a> or
already have one, getting visitors to your website is a primary goal. SEO or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">Search Engine Optimisation</a> is the set of techniques which
will help you achieve this goal.</p>

<p>The SEO industry helps companies with a web
presence achieve better rankings within search engines. There are a lot of different methods used by SEO companies. Some of
these can improve your rankings. Others, however, can adversely affect your business.</p>

<p>A lot of the reasons behind using a company specialising in SEO no longer apply in the web-standards based development
environment. <a href="/services/websites/">Our web packages</a> are built with all the best practices in mind. Because of
this, large, expensive and involved after-market SEO campaigns are almost always unnecessary and usually have very little
impact on your search enginge ranking.</p>

<p><a href="/services/websites/">Our web packages</a> employ numerous techniques which help your site gain good results in
search engines from day one. We use the following techniques to help you achieve good search engine rankings:</p>

<h4>Structured, semantic HTML</h4>

<p>Our web packages are built using the latest web standards best practices. The templates use semantic HTML and are styled
with CSS. <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> are also used throughout the packages. All of these factors
help search engines understand your content and allow them to process the information better.</p>

<h4>XML sitemaps</h4>

<p>Our web packages automatically generate <a href="http://sitemaps.org">XML sitemaps</a> for your entire site. When we
complete your website, we also submit them to Google and Yahoo! This helps search engines find your site and all your pages.
If your website is brand new, this is a great starting point, especially if your website does not have any incoming
links.</p>

<h4>Nice and SEO-friendly URLs</h4>

<p>Our web packages also generate your page URLs based on the title of your page. This has a threefold effect. Firstly, it
means the URLs are easy to read, understand and remember. Secondly, because the URLs are based on your page title, the
keywords of each page are duplicated. Finally, search engines emphasise words within the URL, so your keywords are even
stronger.</p>

<p>Every website we build, whether it&#8217;s a <a href="/services/websites/">web package</a> or completely custom, features
all these SEO-based techniques.</p>

<h4>Completing your SEO Campaign</h4>

<p>There are two other influential factors which will help make your SEO campaign a success. First of all we can advise on
the content for your site � remember <a href="http://www.akamarketing.com/content-is-king.html" title="An Internet marketing
article by David Callan">content is king</a>. And we can also help you build links to your website because the more ways
search engines can find your site the better! These two factors will have the biggest impact in your search engine
ranking.</p>

		<title type="text">Reasons to re-brand</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons for re-branding - an external event may have changed the position for your product in the market
place, maybe you have recently merged with another company or most commonly you recognise that you simply need a fresh
change of clothes to stay inline with the competition. Popular consumer brands are ever evolving their marketing and
packaging in an attempt to endear customers through the &#8216;attitude&#8217; and &#8216;personality&#8217; of their
brand.</p>

<p>I remember when Bradford and Bingley were two middle-aged gentlemen in pinstripe suits and bowler hats, presumably
because only &#8216;business men&#8217; have bank accounts - right? The latest face of Bradford &amp; Bingley is an
attractive and friendly young woman in a lime green shirt and, of course, a bowler hat - which is now just for comedy
effect, oh and brand recognition. Perfectly approachable and without a whiff of stock-market or Financial Times about
her.</p>

<p>I have put together some points about re-branding, really in terms of the evolution of an existing corporate ID rather
than a total corporate rebirth, to help you determine whether it&#8217;s time for a fresh set of clothes.</p>

<h4>10 Reasons to re-brand</h4>

<ul>
<li>To revitalise an existing brand</li>
<li>To incorporate major changes in the product or service</li>
<li>To improve customer connection</li>
<li>To improve the image of the product and increase sales</li>
<li>To increase competitiveness and reduce threat from new entrants</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t already have a brand, you have a collection of logo versions and collateral materials</li>
<li>If you feel you have lost touch with the people you intended to attract</li>
<li>If you want your company to appear &#8216;forward thinking&#8217;</li>
<li>If your competition has a better image</li>
<li>If your customers don&#8217;t recognise your brand or can&#8217;t figure out what you do</li>
</ul>

<h4>5 Re-branding fears</h4>

<h5><em>Existing customers will not recognise us</em></h5>

<p>It is a common concern that change could put a lot of goodwill and customer loyalty at risk. I would not condone a
re-brand that was a complete U-turn unless the current brand was obviously turning customers away. These days people expect
improvements to products and services which cater evermore specifically to the needs of the individual. A modest brand
makeover could actually help to reinforce existing customer loyalty by contributing to &#8216;post purchase
justification&#8217; and ultimately attract new ones. </p>

<h5><em>It will cost too much</em></h5>

<p>What better reason could there be? The knock-on effect of a complete re-brand is undoubtedly a lengthy and costly
exercise. My advice here would be evolve the brand over time and introduce changes in smaller steps - this way the cost of
the new look would be built into the next print run or advert placement, website update or exhibition in such a way that two
generations of corporate ID could co-exist and retain synergy. Car manufacturers constantly introduce
&#8216;evolutionary&#8217; style changes across their model range without letting a single model become the black sheep.</p>

<h5><em>If it ain&#8217;t broke�!</em></h5>

<p>I would be the first to agree that this is a strong argument against a wash and brush up. This attitude suggests that you
are obviously doing something right - for now. However, in any marketplace expectations are constantly rising and it is
always prudent to keep a close eye on the competition.</p>

<h5><em>I&#8217;m skeptical about the benefits of a cohesive brand</em></h5>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard this argument many times and usually goes hand in hand with acute nich� markets or the very naive. If
you are lucky enough to have a product or service that wouldn&#8217;t benefit from a clear brand, marketing plan or customer
focused service standards then keep up the good work. As for the rest, you probably won&#8217;t need to use your seat-belt on
the way home either.</p>

<h5><em>People will think we have resurrected a failed business</em></h5>

<p>Well have you? This mindset might strike fear into the heart of a supplier who&#8217;s hanging on for that &#8216;check
in the post&#8217; but if you feel you have found a great name and can provide real value and meaning to your product or
service this could be exactly what your brand needs. You can advertise your re-brand as a celebration of success, and at the
same time attract interest away from the competition.</p>

<h5><em>-</em></h5>

<p>It is difficult to attribute success to any single influence. The quality of your product or service, customer brand
loyalty, the effectiveness in which you communicate to your market and how you compare to the competition are just a few of
the factors that contribute to securing a sale. But I would always prefer to make a good impression when I take my brand to
market, than hope no-one notices it.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Education in Print</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is that time of year again. Further education colleges up and down the country are finalising their course guides for
the 2008 intake. This week <strong>Tamworth &amp; Lichfield College</strong> and <strong>Kingston College</strong> will be
receiving their newly printed course guides from us.</p>

<p>For most colleges there are two major publications each year, the part time guide and the full time guide. The part time
guide is usually published during the Summer term for the intake of part time students in September of the same year. The
full time guide is completed and printed over the Summer or early in the Autumn term. This guide is then sent out and made
available to potential students joining the college in September the following year. This poses a few presentation problems
for colleges as you have two publications initially out at similar times but overlapping with each other during previous and
following years. However, if a design strategy is in place for organic development of design styles the college branding is
upheld and publications happily blend from one to another. This is something we try to implement with everything we do for
our college clients.</p>

<p>With a few colleges we have managed to build a long standing relationship and help them at every step of the way. This
consistency and commitment from us to always give the very best has paid dividends, with exceptional inspection reports and
positive feedback from both students and staff. This commitment and dedication is something we offer all our clients, after
all, creating the perfect solution is always our goal.</p>

<p>Creation has worked with a long list of colleges over the years, completing almost 700 education projects. These include
corporate ID, course guides, part-time guides, full-time guides, diaries, websites, international publications, advertising,
display panels, posters, photography, signage, touchscreens and a whole lot more. As you can see we have masses of experience
in the education sector and can always offer the best, most efficient solution to any problem. We are finding more and more
that new technology and techniques are paving the way to cost effective solutions with online developments providing the
key.</p>

<p>If you would like to find out more about how you can benefit from our education experience just drop me an email <a

		<title type="text">dConstruct 2007</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had the pleasure of visiting Brighton to attend the <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org" title="User
Experience Design Conference">2007 dConstruct conference</a>. This is a small grass roots conference by <a
href="http://clearleft.com" title="Web Design and Accessibility Consultants">Clearleft</a> which is billed as &#8216;an
affordable, one-day conference aimed at those designing and building the latest generation of web-based applications&#8217;.
The topic for this third annual conference was <strong>Designing the User Experience</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uie.com" title="User Interface Engineering">Jared Spool</a> opened the conference with his
enthusiastic, engaging and entertaining presentation entitled &#8220;<em>The Dawning of the Age of Experience</em>&#8221;.
Jared talked about the iPod (as did almost every presentation). The iPod isn&#8217;t the best MP3 player technologically
speaking, but because the user experience is so rich the device is by far the highest selling product in the market. The
iPod doesn&#8217;t have all the features other MP3 players have, but functionality commonly found on other devices has been
cleverly moved to iTunes. More often than not you manage your music on a computer and Apple has recognised this behaviour.
They have moved such functionality to iTunes leaving the iPod less cluttered and easier to use � all which lead to <em>great
user experience</em>. This great user experience is something you should be building in to every service you provide.</p>

<p>Jared also compared <a href="http://www.netflix.com" title="Netflix DVD Rental">Netflix</a>, a relatively new online-only
movie rental company, to <a href="http://www.blockbuster.com">Blockbuster</a>, the well established DVD rental company, with
over five-thousand stores in the US alone. Over recent years Netflix has become twice as large as Blockbuster. But they
don&#8217;t advertise and they don&#8217;t have retail stores, so why have they become so successful? They found out 85% of
existing customers had a friend recommend the service to them. Because they spend their money of designing their website and
improving user experience, they do not need conventional marketing to become extremely successful. <strong>User experience
makes and breaks products and services.</strong></p>

<p>Jared was followed by another American, <a href="http://peterme.com" title="Links, thoughts, and essays from Peter
Merholz">Peter Merholz</a>, who works for <a href="http://adaptivepath.com" title="An experience strategy and design firm
based in San Francisco">Adaptive Path</a> and talked on the subject of &#8220;<em>Experience Strategies</em>&#8221;. Peter
started with a history lesson about camera development in the late eighteen-hundreds.</p>

<p>Up to the turn of the nineteenth century, photography wasn&#8217;t very accessible, requiring complex understanding of
fundamentals and needing seventeen steps to complete the process. Kodak developed a &#8220;3 step camera&#8221; and their
slogan was &#8220;<em>You press the button, we do the rest</em>&#8221;. Kodak didn&#8217;t change how photographs were
developed, they simply recognised that the user should not need to know this information to take photographs. All the user
had to do was push the button and send the film off, Kodak then did the rest. And because of this user experience Kodak have
been the premier brand in the photography industry for over one hundred years.</p>

<p>Secondly Peter talked about a pyramid of product evolution:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the bottom is the underlying product technology.</li>
<li>Second are features. Features make technology more usable. Beware, simply cramming in features can ruin a product.</li>
<li>Finally, experience is the most important part of the pyramid. Focus on what people want to do, and hide the rest � see
the iPod!</li>
</ul>

<p>All these steps are required and each is important, but the user experience can either ruin or make the product a great
success.</p>

<p>The first two presentations complemented each other perfectly. Peter referenced and expanded upon information which Jared
had just talked about and the two speaker styles fitted together very well. Both speakers were engaging, knowledgeable and
able to communicate their experience extremely well.</p>

<p>After lunch <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>, one of the event organisers, introduced <a
href="http://cameronmoll.com" title="Authentic Boredom is the platitudinous web home of Cameron Moll">Cameron Moll</a> for
the so-called &#8220;graveyard-watch&#8221;, in which he presented &#8220;<em>Good vs. Great Design</em>&#8221;. Cameron
talked about choices which distinguish great design from good design and stated that this contributes to user experience
because &#8220;great design yields meaningful communication&#8221;. Cameron posed the following question, which I felt was
intriguing�</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4>Using a microwave, which takes less time?</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Heating water for <strong>one minute</strong> and <strong>ten seconds</strong>?</li>
  <li>Heating it for <strong>one minute</strong> and <strong>eleven seconds</strong>?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>A trick question? Partially. Below this question Cameron stated &#8220;User productivity trumps machine
productivity&#8221;. Although it maybe quicker for the machine (microwave), the overall process for the <em>user</em> is
slower. In choice one the user has to locate two buttons, 1 and zero, which are usually positioned away from each other. The
second choice requires one button, and therefore is quicker for the user. This is very important to remember when developing
any software applications, you should think about user efficiency over the ease of programming.</p>

<p>Finally, the conference finished with <a href="http://plasticbag.org" title="A weblog by Tom Coates concerning future
media, social software and the web of data">Tom Coates</a>, a former employee at the BBC who is currently heading up a very
interesting research project called <a href="http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com">FireEagle</a> at Brickhouse Yahoo!. Tom
talked on the most technical-orientated subject of the day in his presentation &#8220;<em>Designing for a Web of
Data</em>&#8221;.</p>

<p>I am very interested in the &#8216;web of data&#8217; idea � all of the possibilities and phenomenal potential it
contains. I believe this topic will be a huge part of the internet in the next few years. If you are intrigued I highly
recommend viewing Tom&#8217;s other presentation on the subject &#8220;<em>Native to a Web of Data</em>&#8221;. You can <a
href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/02/my_future_of_web_apps_slides/">view the slides</a> and <a
href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit/2006/london/" title="Audio from all the presentations at The Future of Web Apps
2006">listen to the audio</a> from the presentation which I watched at The Future of Web Apps in early 2006.</p>

<h4>Other presentations</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.disambiguity.com">Leisa Reichelt</a> presented &#8220;<em>Waterfall Bad, Washing Machine
Good</em>&#8221; in which she talked about project development methodologies, discussing the differences between sequential
methodologies and &#8216;iterative, incremental and collaborative/cross-disciplinary methodologies&#8217;. The talk was more
project-management orientated, but enlighten the benefits of Agile and User Centred Design (UCD) practices.</p>

<p><a href="http://george08.blogspot.com">George Oates</a> and <a href="http://www.kaiusdesign.com">Denise Wilton</a> had an
informal chat on the sofa entitled &#8220;<em>Human Traffic</em>&#8221;. These two talked about the processes their
respective companies go through when making design and interface choices and how they are handled in the fast
response/feedback nature of the internet. Personally, this was my least favourite talk of the conference.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>The Experience Stack</em>&#8221; presented by <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/">Matt Webb</a> was an
interesting talk. Matt threw away common presentation structure and gave a sporadic and sprawling talk about
&#8216;experience&#8217;. I felt some of the slides were confusing and because of the unrelated nature of the presentation,
understanding the overall premise was difficult. Matt has <a
href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/09/09/the-experience-stack-at-dconstruct-2007/" title="The Experience Stack at
d.construct 2007">understood there was a problem</a> with his talk but has tried to address this in an article called <a
href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2007/09/09/the-experience-stack-revisited/">The Experience Stack revisited</a>. Matt
has put his <a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/2007/stack/">slides online</a> with extensive notes.</p>

<p>Overall I really enjoyed the conference and thought it was a great success. <a href="http://www.andybudd.com">Andy
Budd</a>, one of the organisers, <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/09/deconstructing/" title="deconstructing
dConstruct 2007">summed up the conference</a> and mentioned what I felt about conferences in general:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best conferences I find are always the ones that try to inspire rather than educate. � [we] walked into the office
this morning with a renewed interest in our field and a desire to try out some new techniques and ideas. I hope you felt the
same way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I did.</strong></p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Why the Helvetica?</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People have asked me why Helvetica is so commonly used in design. I&#8217;ve heard comments like &#8220;It&#8217;s
boring&#8221;, and &#8220;It&#8217;s just the default font in Word&#8221;. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a> is a sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss
graphic designer Max Miedinger and has earned its respect with designers because it&#8217;s simply one of the most versatile
font sets in existence. With an extensive range of weights and styles it can span many applications from industrial signage
to fashion brands. And in practical terms, Helvetica&#8217;s small &#8216;x&#8217; height makes typography ledgible at
smaller point sizes, which in turn allows a greater word count per page.</p>

<p>Most people&#8217;s experience of Helvetica will probably be as a system font on their PC, where they don&#8217;t have
access to the full range of weights Helvetica offers; which is a real shame, as it deprives these users of its true strength
� its versatility.</p>

<p>In some respects its popularity has been its undoing. The general consensus is that the decision to use Helvetica is one
that &#8216;lacks creativity&#8217; in itself, and in many ways that&#8217;s true, given that is has been used so badly, so
often. The truth is, however, that any design can carry a thoughtful typographic use of Helvetica.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying Helvetica is the solution to every problem, but it&#8217;s difficult deny the font&#8217;s usability
and longevity. I&#8217;ve grown to appreciate Helvetica the more I work with it, not only for it&#8217;s sheer range of
usable weights but for it&#8217;s pure simplicity and clarity. I love it.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Web Usability Basics</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a recent usability study we carried out on behalf of Kingston College we noticed a few common issues which a lot of
websites have. There are a few basic issues which are often overlooked, but can be resolved relatively easily. Web usability
should be an important focus when commissioning a new website as it can add significant value to your online presence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Development projects should spend 10% of their budget on usability. Following a usability redesign, websites increase
desired metrics by 135% on average.<br />
  <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030107.html">Return on Investment for Usability</a> by Jakob Nielsen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Below are a few common usability blunders and how to solve them.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every page (except for the homepage) should have an obvious link back to the homepage. The words &#8220;Home&#8221;
should be used in the majority of cases. Other ways can be used as well, but these should be <em>in conjunction</em> with an
explicit link.</p></li>
<li><p>The company logo or site banner should be placed in a prominent position at the top of the design � convention tends
towards the top-left, and user-expectation dictates that the logo should link back to the homepage.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation should be in a consistent, prominent position and be obvious of it&#8217;s function. The current active
section should be highlighted sufficiently differently from the other links in the main navigation. The navigation should be
clear and answer three questions: Where am I? Where have I been? and Where can I go?</p></li>
<li><p>Your homepage should clearly articulate who you are, what you do, what your site offers and why it is of value to
users. This is usually achieved by a one sentance tagline/strapline which should appear in the site&#8217;s window title and
on the homepage.</p></li>
<li><p>Content should be clear, simple and concise. Information should be easy to scan as findability is paramount in user
experience. You should avoid using jargon and write using plain and easy to understand terminology. Lists and short
paragraphs are quick to read and easy to digest.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These easy steps can vastly improve the usability of your website. Better usability will keep users interested and
engaged with your content because their experience of your site was pleasant. Users will return often and are more likely to
recommend your site.</p>

		<title type="text">A Useful Link</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whilst looking through the <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">Business Link website</a> I wondered how many of you
have spoken to Business Link and taken advantage of what they have to offer. </p>

<p>The site itself is crammed with useful information and details of what help is available. The section on <a
href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.l1=1073858790&amp;topicId=1073866776&amp;site=131&amp;r.s=tl">grants</a>
is particularly interesting as you can enter a few details to see what funding is there for you to apply for. Give them a
call, and see how they can help you. We&#8217;ve dealt with many people from Business Link and I can honestly say they are
always very helpful and professional. Many of our clients have benefited and received grants towards websites, design work
and other consultancy fees. The most recent of which is <a href="/portfolio/websites/instant-training-website/">Instant
Training</a> based in Telford, who have just seen their gorgeous new site go live.</p>

<p>To make it easier for you, <a href="/">Creation</a> are on the approved list of Business Link Consultants and have been
for a number of years. This means, if you ask us to do the work, you can claim any grant assistance available to you.
Sometimes this can be up to 50% towards the cost of a new website, for example. </p>

<p>Find your <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">local Business Link branch</a> and call them to see what&#8217;s
available to you. If I can be of any help, just let me know and I will point you in the right direction.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Easy Money?</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok. I&#8217;ll keep this short because it&#8217;s day two and I&#8217;m sure you are already tired of the new <a
href="http://www.london2012.com">London 2012</a> Olympic logo scandal.</p>

<p>I picked up the general vibe of disapproval through the media a few hours before I saw the logo and couldn&#8217;t wait
to form my own opinion on this &#8220;<em>obscene waste of tax payers money</em>&#8221;. </p>

<p>My initial reactions were &#8220;<em>it&#8217;s not what I expected</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>it&#8217;s also very
basic</em>&#8221; � and for me, these two reactions are both positive ones.</p>

<p>I expected to see a flowing, freehand, prancing human form suspended over the word &#8216;London&#8217; in an optimistic
script font - like many of the European sporting events that have come before. Thankfully the logo is nothing like this.
It&#8217;s simple, as all good logos should be, and must be seen in context to be properly appreciated. I&#8217;m truly
relieved that the design has avoided the red, white and blue, British war-paint colourway, designed to intimidate non
patriots. <a href="http://www.olympic.org">The Olympics</a> is a no prejudice global gathering not a fight on our turf.</p>

<p>I understand the general public&#8217;s reaction to a cluster of geometric shapes baring a price tag of �400,000.
However, consider the research and deliberation behind a complete and incredibly high-profile graphic identity for an
international event, coordinated by an agency with the branding pedigree of <a href="http://www.wolffolins.com">Wolff
Olins</a> and the price seems quite reasonable to me.</p>

<p>In my opinion the new London 2012 Olympic logo is unique and distinguishable and the work behind it&#8217;s creation
should not be underestimated. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Holmes">Kelly Holmes</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_%28athlete%29">Michael Johnson</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_%28athlete%29">Jonathan Edwards</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafa_Powell">Asafa Powell</a> � true experts in their field make it all look so
easy.</p>

<p>No doubt that the <a href="http://www.london2012.com">2012 Olympics</a> will be an historic and spectacular event. As for
the logo, it&#8217;s appeal will grow - trust me.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Cycle Scheme</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had a fantastically silly idea � I&#8217;ll start cycling to work. After looking around on a few websites I
found a bike I was happy with, a Specialized Hardrock. However, I then found out about a government funded <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> which allows you to get a bike tax free.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> works in saving you money in a few ways. Firstly, your
company buys the bike VAT-free. Secondly, the bike is paid for over a period of twelve or eighteen months, with the money
coming directly from your wages. This means two things: you&#8217;re basically getting the bike interest-free for the length
of the term repayments and you are saving both national insurance and income tax because the payment comes out
<em>before</em> these are calculated and taken.</p>

<p>Beware, although the repayments may look higher than you expected and total more than you expected to save over the
course of the year, the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employee,calculator.htm">savings calculator</a> is actually
pretty accurate. If you calculate your net pay sacrifice over the term of your repayments, the total is more or less the
same as on the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employee,calculator.htm">savings calculator</a> because you&#8217;re
paying less tax over the year.</p>

<p>Opting in to the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> was a fairly easy process (at least for me as
the employee), although it did feel like it took longer than necessary. Just <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employer,register.htm">ask your employer to sign up</a> for the scheme, then find a local
bike shop (or online retailer) who participate. The Cycle Scheme website has a page to <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/bikeshop,partner_finder.htm">help you find your nearest participating retailer</a> -
simply enter your postcode and away you go!</p>

<p>With the savings I was able to enjoy with the scheme I decided to get a Specialized Rockhopper Pro instead. It looks
amazing, it&#8217;s very lightweight and rides nicely. Unfortunately, it is <em>not immune</em> from <strong>getting
punctures</strong> which I found out on my first sixteen-mile return trip to work.</p>

<p>Overall, if you&#8217;re planning on cycling to work in the near future, or if you already cycle to work but are looking
to replace your worn-out ten-year-old bike, definitely persuade your employer to sign on to the <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> which means you will save yourself some money and get a fresh new bike
� just in time for a glorious summer.</p>]]></content>
