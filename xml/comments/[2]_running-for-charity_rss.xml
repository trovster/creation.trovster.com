		<link>/news/2007/05/08/running-for-charity/#c_11</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to add that you will see PRATS training for the event every Tuesday around Penkridge between the hours of
6p.m. and 7p.m.</p>

<p>You are welcome to join &#8216;Penkridge Running And Training Squad&#8217;. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to get fit and
the more the merrier. Besides, we need all the help we can get to carry Leigh home after we stop off at The Boat for a
&#8216;quick half&#8217;.</p>
