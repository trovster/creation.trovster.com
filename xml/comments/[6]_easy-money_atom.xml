		<html:title type="text">Easy Money?</html:title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Err?</p>

<p>Well at least we agree that the general public don&#8217;t like it! - but then I don&#8217;t base my opinions on what the
general public think.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m excited about Britain being the host nation for the 2012 Olympics and I want to back it all the way and
if embracing the branding and running with it means I&#8217;m on my own. Cool. Like supporting my daughter at her school
sports day - win or lose I just don&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>I still think that we haven&#8217;t seen the full story yet. I like the logo because it is unconventional. I like Britain
when it&#8217;s unconventional. I like free thinkers.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Comment #8 on Easy Money? by Trevor Morris</title>
		<html:title type="text">Easy Money?</html:title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first saw the London 2012 Olympic logo I <strong>absolutely hated it</strong>. It seemed my initial reaction was
in-line with the rest of the UK population, and according to <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6718243.stm">a BBC poll on the subject</a> <em>78% of the
population would give the logo the &#8220;wooden spoon&#8221;</em>. I felt the chosen range of colours where too strong and
the jagged design didn&#8217;t fit in to the perceived &#8216;Olympic logo&#8217; convention.</p>

<p>however, after reading a few design-related articles and talking with other designers on the subject, I started to
re-think initial gut reaction. The logo is completely different to anything previously considered as an Olympic logo � and I
think that is a Good Thing�. If you look at some of the <a
href="/news/2007/06/06/easy-money/four-previous-olympic-logos/">previous Olympic logo designs</a>
you&#8217;ll notice they&#8217;re all very similar � a sports-related stylistic flame, with the country and year in a script
font underneath, followed by the Olympic rings in their original colours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s not a logo, it&#8217;s a brand that will take us forward for the next five years � and will evolve in the
run-up to the Games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people think saying the logo will evolve is a &#8216;get-out clause&#8217;, but if you see the <a
href="/news/2007/06/06/easy-money/london-2012-olympic-logo-in-context/">logo in context</a> it
looks a lot less confrontational. You have to remember that this brand has to last the next five years, we have only seen
the tip of the potential of this brand. Already the team at <a href="http://www.wolffolins.com">Wolff Olins</a> have
released plans for the next stage branding, specifically with the controversial logo - sponsors and sports clubs can use
imagery within the logo, while only maintaining the shape, rings and the word &#8216;London&#8217;.</p>

<p>At least one thing can be said about the launch � the majority of the public in the UK know and will be able to recognise
the London 2012 Olympic logo, and this can only be a good thing for the Games. Wait a couple of months, and people will have
forgotten about the initial outrage and will accept the marketing complain. Trust professionals, they can see the complete
vision.</p>]]></content>

		<html:title type="text">Easy Money?</html:title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey guys, glad to see all is well with you, and cheers Tim :-)</p>

<p>Yeah - my gravatar pic may be a touch out of date. It&#8217;s from 1983 or there-abouts!</p>

<p>As for the public aspect, you may be misunderstanding me. They shouldn&#8217;t be let anywhere near the design itself,
but the whole point of any logo or branding exercise is that it&#8217;s the public reaction that is vital. They are the
audience. They may not be able to design, or appreciate details, or reasons why something visual works - but they know what
they like and react on an instinctive level. They are the barometer of success.</p>

<p>A logo can satisfy any number of client thoughts and desires, but if the public don&#8217;t see it in the same way as the
client, then the logo has failed. A logo is supposed to be a unique identifier, recognisable, individual, and to counjour up
brand values.</p>

<p>This logo doesn&#8217;t vibe with the public. It doesn&#8217;t say anything to them apart from &#8220;oh, is that
supposed to be 2012?&#8221;. It is, frankly, too bloody clever for its own good. The problem is not the design, the problem
is with the goals the design satisfies. Too much of trying to be all things to all men, and nothing offensive. For my money,
I&#8217;d have promoted the Britishness which is completely ignored in this design. Isn&#8217;t the point of the Olympic
rotation of hosts that some unique flavour is imbibed into it? Isn&#8217;t it expected that the &#8216;experience&#8217;
will be different in different host nations?</p>

<p>I think this country is too caught up on excluding uniqueness because its seen as threatening community. What ought to be
going on is the celebration of uniqueness within the context of community, not the exclusion of it to force community.</p>]]></content>

		<html:title type="text">Easy Money?</html:title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t particularly like the logo, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I think it is bad. If it does the job well and is
well executed then that&#8217;s good. The look and feel fit well with it&#8217;s intended use and how it will work in
various mediums. </p>

<p>Something to also take into account with this ID is the amount of free publicity it has generated and how awareness of
the pending Olympics has been raised. All good. </p>

<p>I suggest everyone looks at this logo as a &#8216;Marmite&#8217; design. Some will love it some will hate it. As with
anything creative, you will never please everybody all the time.</p>]]></content>

<p>Think my daughter is in the wrong nursery. I can clearly see from your gravatar that you are about the same age and she
thinks quango is a fizzy orange drink with bubbles that tickle your nose.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you think that if you let the public loose on a decision like this you would be taking the ultimate
&#8216;design by committee&#8217; route to disaster?</p>

<p>I think the fact that Joe Public doesn&#8217;t like it is an automatic win! Lets face it, I hold the public totally
responsible for Hear&#8217;Say, David Sneddon, Michelle Mcmanus and Jade Goode.</p>

<p>Sometimes Daddy knows best or Robyn would be in a class of 12 Spidermen, 14 Cinderellas and a Noddy.</p>

<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget, the Olympics is a global event and the rest of the world might love the ID.</p>

<p>P.S. Matt - your post was written like a true professional, thanks for taking the time to respond - I feel this
discussion could run and run. Good to have you back, in mind if not in body.</p>]]></content>

		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that the logo satisfies the brief very well. The trouble is the brief was clearly produced via quango
- and this is the sort of result you get when a committee tries to be everything to everyone. You end up with something no
one likes, apart from the people sat in the meetings that already know what the logo is supposed to represent.</p>

<p>Joe Public don&#8217;t like it, and that&#8217;s an automatic fail. What&#8217;s been missed is that the logo design (any
logo design) is judged by the public - not by the client. It&#8217;s all about the public&#8217;s perceptions,
understandings, and reactions, not the clients. The public don&#8217;t understand, appreciate, or like this logo. The
failure was at the goal setting stage - too many people involved aiming for their own ideas, and not that of the public.</p>

<p>Also, congratulations on the new site guys, it&#8217;s spanking lovely!</p>]]></content>

		<html:title type="text">Easy Money?</html:title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to a couple of people about the 2012 branding, and the general consensus was &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s just
crap</em>&#8221;. Now, does that mean that each of these people has some higher understanding of what it takes to brand an
event as prestigious as the Olympic Games, that they have some insider knowledge as to the brief to which Wolff Olins were
being guided, or that the initial reveal simply took them by surprise?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure when the next Big Brother housemate gets evicted for being a bit naughty and everyone&#8217;s found
something else to argue over, they&#8217;ll come back to the 2012 branding and it&#8217;ll feel just that little bit more
familiar.</p>]]></content>
