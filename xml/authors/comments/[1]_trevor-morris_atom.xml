		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Creation website uses Helvetica as its main text, however, the majority of users will see Arial as they do not have
Helvetica installed. The minority of users will notice a difference. The use of Helvetica in web, compared to print, is a
lot different because of this lack of control.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people do not realise the difference between Helvetica and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial"
title="Arial on Wikipedia">Arial</a>. Arial has been packaged with Microsoft Windows and therefore has gained great market
penetration. Because of the general awareness and lack of understanding of the font differences, people regard Helvetica as
being over used, <em>when it&#8217;s not</em>!</p>

<p>Helvetica, on the surface, looks like a very simple typeface. However, because of its many weights the font is very
versatile and can be used in numerous and exciting ways as <a href="/company/rich-rees/">Rich</a>
pointed out in his article.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Comment #8 by Trevor Morris</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first saw the London 2012 Olympic logo I <strong>absolutely hated it</strong>. It seemed my initial reaction was
in-line with the rest of the UK population, and according to <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6718243.stm">a BBC poll on the subject</a> <em>78% of the
population would give the logo the &#8220;wooden spoon&#8221;</em>. I felt the chosen range of colours where too strong and
the jagged design didn&#8217;t fit in to the perceived &#8216;Olympic logo&#8217; convention.</p>

<p>however, after reading a few design-related articles and talking with other designers on the subject, I started to
re-think initial gut reaction. The logo is completely different to anything previously considered as an Olympic logo � and I
think that is a Good Thing�. If you look at some of the <a
href="/news/2007/06/06/easy-money/four-previous-olympic-logos/">previous Olympic logo designs</a>
you&#8217;ll notice they&#8217;re all very similar � a sports-related stylistic flame, with the country and year in a script
font underneath, followed by the Olympic rings in their original colours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s not a logo, it&#8217;s a brand that will take us forward for the next five years � and will evolve in the
run-up to the Games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people think saying the logo will evolve is a &#8216;get-out clause&#8217;, but if you see the <a
href="/news/2007/06/06/easy-money/london-2012-olympic-logo-in-context/">logo in context</a> it
looks a lot less confrontational. You have to remember that this brand has to last the next five years, we have only seen
the tip of the potential of this brand. Already the team at <a href="http://www.wolffolins.com">Wolff Olins</a> have
released plans for the next stage branding, specifically with the controversial logo - sponsors and sports clubs can use
imagery within the logo, while only maintaining the shape, rings and the word &#8216;London&#8217;.</p>

<p>At least one thing can be said about the launch � the majority of the public in the UK know and will be able to recognise
the London 2012 Olympic logo, and this can only be a good thing for the Games. Wait a couple of months, and people will have
forgotten about the initial outrage and will accept the marketing complain. Trust professionals, they can see the complete
vision.</p>]]></content>
