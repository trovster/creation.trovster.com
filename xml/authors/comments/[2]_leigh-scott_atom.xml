		<title type="text">Comment #6 by Leigh Scott</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t particularly like the logo, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I think it is bad. If it does the job well and is
well executed then that&#8217;s good. The look and feel fit well with it&#8217;s intended use and how it will work in
various mediums. </p>

<p>Something to also take into account with this ID is the amount of free publicity it has generated and how awareness of
the pending Olympics has been raised. All good. </p>

<p>I suggest everyone looks at this logo as a &#8216;Marmite&#8217; design. Some will love it some will hate it. As with
anything creative, you will never please everybody all the time.</p>]]></content>
