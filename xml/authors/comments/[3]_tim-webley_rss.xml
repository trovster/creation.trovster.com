		<title>Comment #53 by Tim Webley</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/news/2007/09/06/why-the-helvetica/#c_53</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Back in 1987 I got my hands on a Letraset Catalogue. It was absolutely crammed with every bizarre typeface you could
imagine. I took it to college for inspiration, desperate for that project where I could let loose on fonts like <a
href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/calypso/">Calypso</a>, <a
href="http://www.linotype.com/1470/shatter-family.html">Shatter</a> and <a
href="http://www.linotype.com/90530/itczipperregular-font.html">Zipper!</a></p>

<p>Our tutor was way past it, probably in his forties, and warned us of the dangers of badly designed typefaces and spent
two full terms trying to guide us to the conclusion that classic fonts like Helvetica were popular for a reason. Boring!</p>

<p>Once in the industry it didn&#8217;t take long to realise that typography was a tool to make information accessible.
Combine the placement and proportion of text with the right typeface and the possibilities are infinite. </p>

<p>It is naive to think that creativity relies solely upon the &#8216;inventiveness&#8217; of a font. When you read
Helvetica you see the message not the typeface - a great example of how &#8216;good design should be invisible.&#8217; </p>

<p>Where was I�?</p>

<p>Ironically the cover of that Catalogue had the word &#8216;Letraset&#8217; written vertically up the right hand edge in�
(well what do you think?)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll give you a clue; it wasn&#8217;t Calypso, Shatter or Zipper.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I hope you are sitting down when you read this Lyndsey. The logo is rumoured to have cost �400,000 - that&#8217;s four
hundred thousand pounds!</p>

<p>Thanks for putting your point across, I can see from your website that we have a creative thinker in the making.</p>

<p>P.S. Turn your spell checker on :)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan, your article &#8216;The Real Logo Story&#8217; highlights some very interesting points.</p>

<p>Recently I heard someone say that &#8220;good design should be invisible.&#8221; Well if the brief is to integrate
seamlessly, follow convention or to function ergonomically then I agree. If the brief is to get noticed or provoke a
reaction then &#8216;bingo!&#8217;, the new Olympic logo wins again. Maybe the logo does stink, but then it wouldn&#8217;t
take scientist to recognise the benefits of Dayglo doggy doo.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I would like to add that you will see PRATS training for the event every Tuesday around Penkridge between the hours of
6p.m. and 7p.m.</p>

<p>You are welcome to join &#8216;Penkridge Running And Training Squad&#8217;. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to get fit and
the more the merrier. Besides, we need all the help we can get to carry Leigh home after we stop off at The Boat for a
&#8216;quick half&#8217;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Err?</p>

<p>Well at least we agree that the general public don&#8217;t like it! - but then I don&#8217;t base my opinions on what the
general public think.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m excited about Britain being the host nation for the 2012 Olympics and I want to back it all the way and
if embracing the branding and running with it means I&#8217;m on my own. Cool. Like supporting my daughter at her school
sports day - win or lose I just don&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>I still think that we haven&#8217;t seen the full story yet. I like the logo because it is unconventional. I like Britain
when it&#8217;s unconventional. I like free thinkers.</p>

<p>Think my daughter is in the wrong nursery. I can clearly see from your gravatar that you are about the same age and she
thinks quango is a fizzy orange drink with bubbles that tickle your nose.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you think that if you let the public loose on a decision like this you would be taking the ultimate
&#8216;design by committee&#8217; route to disaster?</p>

<p>I think the fact that Joe Public doesn&#8217;t like it is an automatic win! Lets face it, I hold the public totally
responsible for Hear&#8217;Say, David Sneddon, Michelle Mcmanus and Jade Goode.</p>

<p>Sometimes Daddy knows best or Robyn would be in a class of 12 Spidermen, 14 Cinderellas and a Noddy.</p>

<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget, the Olympics is a global event and the rest of the world might love the ID.</p>

<p>P.S. Matt - your post was written like a true professional, thanks for taking the time to respond - I feel this
discussion could run and run. Good to have you back, in mind if not in body.</p>
