		<title type="text">Comment #3 by Rich Rees</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve spoken to a couple of people about the 2012 branding, and the general consensus was &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s just
crap</em>&#8221;. Now, does that mean that each of these people has some higher understanding of what it takes to brand an
event as prestigious as the Olympic Games, that they have some insider knowledge as to the brief to which Wolff Olins were
being guided, or that the initial reveal simply took them by surprise?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure when the next Big Brother housemate gets evicted for being a bit naughty and everyone&#8217;s found
something else to argue over, they&#8217;ll come back to the 2012 branding and it&#8217;ll feel just that little bit more
familiar.</p>]]></content>
