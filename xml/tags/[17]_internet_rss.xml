		<title>New Rules for Websites</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>An update to the Companies Act legislation of 1985 has now come into force. To avoid breaching the <a
href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/bbf/co-act-2006/index.html">Companies Act 2006</a>, from the 1st January 2007, all UK Limited
companies must include certain information on their websites, email footers, order forms and electronic documentation. The
penalty for non-compliance is a ï¿½1000 fine.</p>

<p>Every company should list registered company name, company registration number, place of registration, registered office
address and VAT number (if applicable). This information is already required on business letters and should, as a matter of
good practice, be included on all your company documentation.</p>

<p>If you would like our help to implement these updates on any of your corporate websites and documentation please <a
href="mailto:info@creation.uk.com">email us</a> and we will offer our advice.</p>
