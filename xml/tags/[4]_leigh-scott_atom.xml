		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.greatrun.org">2007 BUPA Great North Run</a> will take place on Sunday 30th September 2007,
it&#8217;s 27th anniversary, and promises to be a day to remember! It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s biggest half marathon, a
point-to-point 13.1 mile course starting in Newcastle and finishing in South Shields. Over 50,000 runners lined up at the
start last year - with hundreds more people watching it from the sidelines and coverage on the BBC.</p>

<p>Luckily, I have managed to get through the selection process to take part in the event this year. This will be my third
half marathon. At the moment I have done two, <a href="http://www.staffordbc.gov.uk/static/page1784.htm">The Stafford Half
Marathon in 2006</a> and in 2007.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be breaking any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_marathon">half marathon records</a>, but will be
raising money for my preferred charities, <a href="http://www.donnalouisetrust.org">The Donna Louise Trust</a> and the <a
href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk">NSPCC</a>. As you can guess I am looking for sponsorship to help out these two very worthy
causes. Any amount no matter how small will go to help unfortunate children.</p>

<p>The run is going to be televised so perhaps you would like me to wear something branded with your company logo for a
donation. A t-shirt, cap, badge, stickers, flag or anything else you may suggest. I may even wear a stupid costume if the
donation is high enough. I will have to draw the line at high heels though and save that sort of thing for my private
weekend activities.</p>

<p>If you would like to help with a donation <a href="mailto:leigh@creation.uk.com">drop me an email</a> or give me a call
at the office on 01785 716136. Thanks Leigh.</p>]]></content>
