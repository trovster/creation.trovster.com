		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok. I&#8217;ll keep this short because it&#8217;s day two and I&#8217;m sure you are already tired of the new <a
href="http://www.london2012.com">London 2012</a> Olympic logo scandal.</p>

<p>I picked up the general vibe of disapproval through the media a few hours before I saw the logo and couldn&#8217;t wait
to form my own opinion on this &#8220;<em>obscene waste of tax payers money</em>&#8221;. </p>

<p>My initial reactions were &#8220;<em>it&#8217;s not what I expected</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>it&#8217;s also very
basic</em>&#8221; – and for me, these two reactions are both positive ones.</p>

<p>I expected to see a flowing, freehand, prancing human form suspended over the word &#8216;London&#8217; in an optimistic
script font - like many of the European sporting events that have come before. Thankfully the logo is nothing like this.
It&#8217;s simple, as all good logos should be, and must be seen in context to be properly appreciated. I&#8217;m truly
relieved that the design has avoided the red, white and blue, British war-paint colourway, designed to intimidate non
patriots. <a href="http://www.olympic.org">The Olympics</a> is a no prejudice global gathering not a fight on our turf.</p>

<p>I understand the general public&#8217;s reaction to a cluster of geometric shapes baring a price tag of £400,000.
However, consider the research and deliberation behind a complete and incredibly high-profile graphic identity for an
international event, coordinated by an agency with the branding pedigree of <a href="http://www.wolffolins.com">Wolff
Olins</a> and the price seems quite reasonable to me.</p>

<p>In my opinion the new London 2012 Olympic logo is unique and distinguishable and the work behind it&#8217;s creation
should not be underestimated. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Holmes">Kelly Holmes</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_%28athlete%29">Michael Johnson</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_%28athlete%29">Jonathan Edwards</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafa_Powell">Asafa Powell</a> – true experts in their field make it all look so
easy.</p>

<p>No doubt that the <a href="http://www.london2012.com">2012 Olympics</a> will be an historic and spectacular event. As for
the logo, it&#8217;s appeal will grow - trust me.</p>]]></content>
