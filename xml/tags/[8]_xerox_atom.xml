		<title type="text">In Partnership with Xerox Global Services</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year we were chosen as a new design partner for Xerox Global Services, the division of Xerox responsible for offering
on-site services for a large number of big companies and organisations nationwide.</p>

<p>Since our introduction to the various sites we have completed a number of projects with successful results. All our
services, including the fixed price packages and solutions listed in our services section, are available to all sites and
all Xerox customers. There are some services available you may not be aware of, in fact, we may not be aware of them yet!
Remember, if you have a design, web or print problem to solve just ask. We&#8217;ve been able to help already on a number of
occasions with excellent results.</p>

<p>We look forward to building a stronger relationship with Xerox and their customers and providing the very best in design
for print and web.</p>

<p>If you need any further help or advice on our partnership and what we can do for you, contact me <a
href="mailto:leigh@creation.uk.com">leigh@creation.uk.com</a>, your print room manager or Xerox representative.</p>]]></content>
