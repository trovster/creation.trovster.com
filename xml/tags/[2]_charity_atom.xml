		<title type="text">Donate Unwanted PCs</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Help students in The Gambia with your unwanted PCs. Following a visit to the region by our good friends at <a
href="http://www.tlc.ac.uk">Tamworth &amp; Lichfield College</a>, John Fontaine and Belinda Ball, we are trying to help them
collect computer equipment for students to use in Gambia.</p>

<p>This part of the world is very poor but everyone is keen to learn. The students have very limited facilities at present
and in some cases are using very old manual typewriters to learn keyboard skills. So our unwanted PCs would be a distinct
step up for them.</p>

<p>John and a friend of the College have made arrangements to ship any working PCs, capable of running Windows 2000, to the
College in The Gambia. A container will be packed up and sent over when it&#8217;s full. <a
href="mailto:leigh@creation.uk.com">Let me know</a> if you have any PCs you would like to donate.</p>

<p>You could also be saving money by helping out, now the Regulations implementing the <a
href="http://www.netregs.gov.uk/netregs/legislation/380525/473094/?lang=_e">WEEE Directive</a> (Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment) in the UK were entered into force on 2nd January 2007. A directive to promote recycling and reduce
waste. Find out more about the WEEE Directive and <a href="http://weeenetwork.com">get Free Advice</a> for all businesses
affected by the regulations.</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Running for Charity</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.greatrun.org">2007 BUPA Great North Run</a> will take place on Sunday 30th September 2007,
it&#8217;s 27th anniversary, and promises to be a day to remember! It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s biggest half marathon, a
point-to-point 13.1 mile course starting in Newcastle and finishing in South Shields. Over 50,000 runners lined up at the
start last year - with hundreds more people watching it from the sidelines and coverage on the BBC.</p>

<p>Luckily, I have managed to get through the selection process to take part in the event this year. This will be my third
half marathon. At the moment I have done two, <a href="http://www.staffordbc.gov.uk/static/page1784.htm">The Stafford Half
Marathon in 2006</a> and in 2007.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t be breaking any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_marathon">half marathon records</a>, but will be
raising money for my preferred charities, <a href="http://www.donnalouisetrust.org">The Donna Louise Trust</a> and the <a
href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk">NSPCC</a>. As you can guess I am looking for sponsorship to help out these two very worthy
causes. Any amount no matter how small will go to help unfortunate children.</p>

<p>The run is going to be televised so perhaps you would like me to wear something branded with your company logo for a
donation. A t-shirt, cap, badge, stickers, flag or anything else you may suggest. I may even wear a stupid costume if the
donation is high enough. I will have to draw the line at high heels though and save that sort of thing for my private
weekend activities.</p>

<p>If you would like to help with a donation <a href="mailto:leigh@creation.uk.com">drop me an email</a> or give me a call
at the office on 01785 716136. Thanks Leigh.</p>]]></content>
