		<title>Cycle Scheme</title>
		<link>http://www.creation.uk.com/news/2007/06/05/cycle-scheme/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had a fantastically silly idea — I&#8217;ll start cycling to work. After looking around on a few websites I
found a bike I was happy with, a Specialized Hardrock. However, I then found out about a government funded <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> which allows you to get a bike tax free.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> works in saving you money in a few ways. Firstly, your
company buys the bike VAT-free. Secondly, the bike is paid for over a period of twelve or eighteen months, with the money
coming directly from your wages. This means two things: you&#8217;re basically getting the bike interest-free for the length
of the term repayments and you are saving both national insurance and income tax because the payment comes out
<em>before</em> these are calculated and taken.</p>

<p>Beware, although the repayments may look higher than you expected and total more than you expected to save over the
course of the year, the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employee,calculator.htm">savings calculator</a> is actually
pretty accurate. If you calculate your net pay sacrifice over the term of your repayments, the total is more or less the
same as on the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employee,calculator.htm">savings calculator</a> because you&#8217;re
paying less tax over the year.</p>

<p>Opting in to the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> was a fairly easy process (at least for me as
the employee), although it did feel like it took longer than necessary. Just <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employer,register.htm">ask your employer to sign up</a> for the scheme, then find a local
bike shop (or online retailer) who participate. The Cycle Scheme website has a page to <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/bikeshop,partner_finder.htm">help you find your nearest participating retailer</a> -
simply enter your postcode and away you go!</p>

<p>With the savings I was able to enjoy with the scheme I decided to get a Specialized Rockhopper Pro instead. It looks
amazing, it&#8217;s very lightweight and rides nicely. Unfortunately, it is <em>not immune</em> from <strong>getting
punctures</strong> which I found out on my first sixteen-mile return trip to work.</p>

<p>Overall, if you&#8217;re planning on cycling to work in the near future, or if you already cycle to work but are looking
to replace your worn-out ten-year-old bike, definitely persuade your employer to sign on to the <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> which means you will save yourself some money and get a fresh new bike
— just in time for a glorious summer.</p>
