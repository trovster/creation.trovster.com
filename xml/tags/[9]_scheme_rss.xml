		<title>Cycle Scheme</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/news/2007/06/05/cycle-scheme/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had a fantastically silly idea � I&#8217;ll start cycling to work. After looking around on a few websites I
found a bike I was happy with, a Specialized Hardrock. However, I then found out about a government funded <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> which allows you to get a bike tax free.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> works in saving you money in a few ways. Firstly, your
company buys the bike VAT-free. Secondly, the bike is paid for over a period of twelve or eighteen months, with the money
coming directly from your wages. This means two things: you&#8217;re basically getting the bike interest-free for the length
of the term repayments and you are saving both national insurance and income tax because the payment comes out
<em>before</em> these are calculated and taken.</p>

<p>Beware, although the repayments may look higher than you expected and total more than you expected to save over the
course of the year, the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employee,calculator.htm">savings calculator</a> is actually
pretty accurate. If you calculate your net pay sacrifice over the term of your repayments, the total is more or less the
same as on the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employee,calculator.htm">savings calculator</a> because you&#8217;re
paying less tax over the year.</p>

<p>Opting in to the <a href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> was a fairly easy process (at least for me as
the employee), although it did feel like it took longer than necessary. Just <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employer,register.htm">ask your employer to sign up</a> for the scheme, then find a local
bike shop (or online retailer) who participate. The Cycle Scheme website has a page to <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/bikeshop,partner_finder.htm">help you find your nearest participating retailer</a> -
simply enter your postcode and away you go!</p>

<p>With the savings I was able to enjoy with the scheme I decided to get a Specialized Rockhopper Pro instead. It looks
amazing, it&#8217;s very lightweight and rides nicely. Unfortunately, it is <em>not immune</em> from <strong>getting
punctures</strong> which I found out on my first sixteen-mile return trip to work.</p>

<p>Overall, if you&#8217;re planning on cycling to work in the near future, or if you already cycle to work but are looking
to replace your worn-out ten-year-old bike, definitely persuade your employer to sign on to the <a
href="http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">Cycle Scheme</a> which means you will save yourself some money and get a fresh new bike
� just in time for a glorious summer.</p>

		<title>Donate Unwanted PCs</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/news/2007/05/20/donate-unwanted-pcs/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Help students in The Gambia with your unwanted PCs. Following a visit to the region by our good friends at <a
href="http://www.tlc.ac.uk">Tamworth &amp; Lichfield College</a>, John Fontaine and Belinda Ball, we are trying to help them
collect computer equipment for students to use in Gambia.</p>

<p>This part of the world is very poor but everyone is keen to learn. The students have very limited facilities at present
and in some cases are using very old manual typewriters to learn keyboard skills. So our unwanted PCs would be a distinct
step up for them.</p>

<p>John and a friend of the College have made arrangements to ship any working PCs, capable of running Windows 2000, to the
College in The Gambia. A container will be packed up and sent over when it&#8217;s full. <a
href="mailto:leigh@creation.uk.com">Let me know</a> if you have any PCs you would like to donate.</p>

<p>You could also be saving money by helping out, now the Regulations implementing the <a
href="http://www.netregs.gov.uk/netregs/legislation/380525/473094/?lang=_e">WEEE Directive</a> (Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment) in the UK were entered into force on 2nd January 2007. A directive to promote recycling and reduce
waste. Find out more about the WEEE Directive and <a href="http://weeenetwork.com">get Free Advice</a> for all businesses
affected by the regulations.</p>
