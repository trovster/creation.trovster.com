		<description><![CDATA[<p>�and with Content Being King, keeping your site fresh and up-to-date is also incredibly important.</p>

<p>I like how the Creation site is a perfect example of this. This news section, for which there is obviously a company
policy asking each member of the team to post something each month, is an excellent way of continually adding new content
that a.) will show up in searches b.) brings visitors back to the site and c.) stops the site from looking stale.  This
content is also surfaced on the front page.</p>

<p>Anyway, just thought I would add that!  Excellent article Trev, keep up the good work!</p>

		<title>Comment #53 by Tim Webley</title>
		<link>/news/2007/09/06/why-the-helvetica/#c_53</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Back in 1987 I got my hands on a Letraset Catalogue. It was absolutely crammed with every bizarre typeface you could
imagine. I took it to college for inspiration, desperate for that project where I could let loose on fonts like <a
href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/calypso/">Calypso</a>, <a
href="http://www.linotype.com/1470/shatter-family.html">Shatter</a> and <a
href="http://www.linotype.com/90530/itczipperregular-font.html">Zipper!</a></p>

<p>Our tutor was way past it, probably in his forties, and warned us of the dangers of badly designed typefaces and spent
two full terms trying to guide us to the conclusion that classic fonts like Helvetica were popular for a reason. Boring!</p>

<p>Once in the industry it didn&#8217;t take long to realise that typography was a tool to make information accessible.
Combine the placement and proportion of text with the right typeface and the possibilities are infinite. </p>

<p>It is naive to think that creativity relies solely upon the &#8216;inventiveness&#8217; of a font. When you read
Helvetica you see the message not the typeface - a great example of how &#8216;good design should be invisible.&#8217; </p>

<p>Where was I�?</p>

<p>Ironically the cover of that Catalogue had the word &#8216;Letraset&#8217; written vertically up the right hand edge in�
(well what do you think?)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll give you a clue; it wasn&#8217;t Calypso, Shatter or Zipper.</p>

		<title>Comment #49 by Trevor Morris</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Creation website uses Helvetica as its main text, however, the majority of users will see Arial as they do not have
Helvetica installed. The minority of users will notice a difference. The use of Helvetica in web, compared to print, is a
lot different because of this lack of control.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people do not realise the difference between Helvetica and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial"
title="Arial on Wikipedia">Arial</a>. Arial has been packaged with Microsoft Windows and therefore has gained great market
penetration. Because of the general awareness and lack of understanding of the font differences, people regard Helvetica as
being over used, <em>when it&#8217;s not</em>!</p>

<p>Helvetica, on the surface, looks like a very simple typeface. However, because of its many weights the font is very
versatile and can be used in numerous and exciting ways as <a href="/company/rich-rees/">Rich</a>
pointed out in his article.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi Lorna. Customising the email with the clients name can easily be done as part of the process. In fact other
personalised data can be included relatively easily throughout the e-shot. I will drop you an email to explain further.
Thank you for your interest.</p>

		<title>Comment #37 by Owen Gregory</title>
		<link>/news/2007/07/17/web-usability-basics/#c_37</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>This is all great advice, Trevor. One point (among many) that&#8217;s worth remembering is: &#8220;Make sure the Back
button will always take the user back along the route they&#8217;ve taken through the site.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many users rely on the Back button to get back to a particular point in a site, however clear the navigation might be.
Some Flash�-based sites and irresponsible scripting can seemingly alter the function of the Back button, confusing users
when they aren&#8217;t returned to a previously visited page or section.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>I hope you are sitting down when you read this Lyndsey. The logo is rumoured to have cost �400,000 - that&#8217;s four
hundred thousand pounds!</p>

<p>Thanks for putting your point across, I can see from your website that we have a creative thinker in the making.</p>

<p>P.S. Turn your spell checker on :)</p>

		<link>/news/2007/06/06/easy-money/#c_50</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan, your article &#8216;The Real Logo Story&#8217; highlights some very interesting points.</p>

<p>Recently I heard someone say that &#8220;good design should be invisible.&#8221; Well if the brief is to integrate
seamlessly, follow convention or to function ergonomically then I agree. If the brief is to get noticed or provoke a
reaction then &#8216;bingo!&#8217;, the new Olympic logo wins again. Maybe the logo does stink, but then it wouldn&#8217;t
take scientist to recognise the benefits of Dayglo doggy doo.</p>
