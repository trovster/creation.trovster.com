		<title>Top Gear &#39;till Christmas!</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/10/08/top-gear-till-christmas/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Getting the kids to bed without breaching the 8 o&#8217;clock deadline has become ever more stressful with the return of
Clarkson, Hammond and the polite one with sympathetic hair in BBC2&#8217;s Top Gear - Sunday 8pm.</p>

<p>While there are still oil reserves man will endeavour to construct evermore creative ways of depleting supplies all in
the name of entertainment. In episode one we see Lamborghini, Porsche, Aston Martin and Volkswagen none the less, doing
their utmost to raise sea levels - fantastic!</p>

<p>Bit worrying to think I&#8217;ll be Christmas wrapping before the series ends in December.</p>

		<title>Living Legend</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/10/03/living-legend/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>They say you can judge a man by his friends - well having a friend like Dave is a sure-fire way of dragging your average
score up. My longest standing mate from 4th year Geography, and some 25 years on we will be celebrating his 39th Birthday
this weekend. This guy is real Swiss Army Knife of a friend - he even a bloody good cook, God damn it!</p>

<p>Of course just knowing a legend doesn&#8217;t make you one yourself - I&#8217;ve got a long way to go but as long as
Martin, Leigh, Rich and Dave don&#8217;t turn into mass murders I think I&#8217;ve got this sewn up.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday dude!</p>

<p>P.S. Alison says <em>&#8220;every super hero has his nemesis - Superman has Kryptonite, Ian&#8217;s is a vacuum
cleaner.&#8221;</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This weekend it was <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-index.htm">The National Trust</a> &#8216;Open
Day&#8217; and if you are interested in the conservation and heritage of our great nation there are many beautiful natural
and historic environments to explore - for free! I took the family to <a
href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-attinghampark.htm">Attingham Park</a>, Shrewsbury
and had a fantastic day. Of course make sure you return on a paying day or they won&#8217;t be here long enough for us to
enjoy. </p>

<p>I would rather have gone to <a href="/company/rich-rees/2007/09/10/renault-world-series/"
title="Renault World Series hot topic">Renault World Series</a> at Donington Park but at least my wife and kids are still
talking to me - unlike Rich.</p>

		<title>Seriously Easy Going</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="http://www.monkey-forest.com">Monkey Forest</a>, Barbary Macaques roam freely in the beautiful, 60-acre,
Trentham Estate woodland. Home for 140 Macaques, Monkey Forest (and three sister parks) is committed to the protection of
the species, successfully re-introducing 600 into the Atlas Mountain, Morocco.</p>

<p>Baby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_Macaque">Barbary Macaques</a>, no more then a few days old, played at
our feet - no bars, no cages. It&#8217;s the relaxed atmosphere of the monkeys that strikes you. The way it should be.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is the 3rd anniversary of one of the most stressful days of my life - my daughter&#8217;s birthday. (It was pretty

<p>Happy Birthday Robyn.</p>

		<title>If you can&#39;t beat em with it�</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/06/18/if-you-cant-beat-em-with-it/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Everywhere I go I see people pawing over their mobiles, mainly while driving, going through the checkout at
Sainsbury&#8217;s or sitting in front of me at the cinema, you know those kind of emergency scenarios. So I guess I&#8217;m
in the minority here because to me a mobile phone is more of life buoy than a &#8216;snooky&#8217; comfort blanket. I
don&#8217;t care what it looks like and, should I ever need it, will be damn glad it&#8217;s there. I fought the temptation
of an upgrade for years while those around me were deep in 3G video conferences at the traffic lights, but then I hit a
point of realization. My old Nokia 8310e went off in my pocket at the park and sounded like a free Happy Meal toy.
Shame.</p>

<p>So I dropped into the nearest Carphone Warehouse and brought the only one in the shop that Paris Hilton wouldn&#8217;t be
seen dead with - the <a
href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&amp;lc=en&amp;ver=4000&amp;template=pip1&amp;zone=pp&amp;pid=10376">Sony
Ericsson w810i</a> and it&#8217;s truly great. I sometimes get it out as I walk to the cash machine to check if I have
missed a call � that way the kids will think I am in demand. Safe.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and if it&#8217;s illegal to use your phone while driving, why is it call the Carphone Warehouse?</p>

you.</p>

		<title>Gone But Not Forgotten</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/04/02/gone-but-not-forgotten/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>Spring is in the air, bluebells carpet the shady woodlands I pass on the daily commute, and all this is made sweeter as
March saw the long awaited arrival of my Mk5 VW Golf GTi. Of course the GTi is out gunned by hotter hatches but at that pace
you&#8217;ll miss all of the lovely bluebells.</p>

<p>I must pay respects to my old Mk4 VW Golf GT TDi PD � thanks for all the years of reliable service � you carried both of
my children safely home from hospital. Not a glitch in nearly six years � you&#8217;re gone but not forgotten.</p>

		<title>True Car Crash TV!</title>
		<link>/company/tim-webley/2007/02/05/true-car-crash-tv/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m finally getting some return for my TV licence - welcome back Top Gear! A refreshing break from cringe worthy
&#8216;Car Crash&#8217; reality TV shows although in the first episode Richard Hammond&#8217;s truly death defying 314mph
car crash was aired. The &#8216;Hamster&#8217; is a really nice bloke and my prayers were answered, it seems, as he made a
full recovery - phew!</p>

<p>You can see <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/show/episodes/series9episode1.shtml">Hammond&#8217;s accident on the
Top Gear website</a></p>

<p>P.S. Ray Meers is worth a couple of quid of the licence fee too.</p>
