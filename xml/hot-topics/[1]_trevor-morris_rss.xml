		<title>After Dark Film Festival</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/company/trevor-morris/2007/10/24/after-dark-film-festival/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.torontoafterdark.com">Toronto After Dark Film Festival</a> showcases thrilling international cinema,
and runs annually during the week before Halloween.</p>

<p>The frightening film festival features a diverse selection of feature film premieres and innovative short films in the
genre of horror, sci-fi, and fantasy.</p>

<p>Last year there was the JHorror film Reincarnation � going on the standard from last year, this years films should be
good as well. If you&#8217;re a horror fan you should definitely pick them up on DVD when they&#8217;re released.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I do not live anywhere near Toronto else I would have definitely attended.</p>

more!).</p>

<p>You can restrict your photos for friends and family, tag them for easy grouping, put them in sets and those within groups
and even add the geo-location information. The data associated with your photos is huge and all available using
Flickr&#8217;s brilliant API.</p>

		<title>Last.fm</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> is &#8220;the social music revolution&#8221;. Simply listen to music on your
computer or iPod and Last.fm will save your playlists. Every song you listen to will become part of your music profile.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve uploaded a few tracks, you can start enjoying all the features, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically create personal music charts and radio station.</li>
<li>Discover, explore and listen to new music.</li>
<li>See what your friends are listening to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because Last.fm is a passive social website, all you need to do is create an account and listen to your music. The main
idea of the website is to record your listening habits, but there is also a nice social aspect to the website. You can
engage with users who listen to similar music and browse for new music based on your taste and listening habits of
others.</p>

		<title>Top Gear is Back!</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/company/trevor-morris/2007/10/04/top-gear-is-back/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/topgear/">Top Gear</a>, everyone&#8217;s favourite petrol-fueled TV show, is back on the BBC
this Sunday (7th October). Hang out with Clarkson, Hammond and Captain Slow for a ten-week run of the best car show on
earth.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll be trans-country challenges (hopefully), stupidly expensive super-cars, celebrities in a reasonably priced
car, the Stig racing around the track and no doubt plenty of non-PC jokes, especially about the Germans.</p>

<p>Tune in at <strong>8pm on Sundays</strong> or catch the repeats on Wednesdays at 7pm.</p>

		<title>Nokia N95</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/company/trevor-morris/2007/09/21/nokia-n95/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>I finally upgraded my mobile phone to a <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n95/index.html">Nokia N95</a>.</p>

<p>This is now my fifth Nokia in a row. I have progressed many iterations including one with a qwerty keyboard (6800), a
6600 and the phone I&#8217;ve just replaced is a 6680. Each time the phone has functioned extremely well and I&#8217;ve
never had one break (yet).</p>

<p>It has an amazing amount of features including Wi-Fi, a five mega-pixel camera and GPS. I&#8217;m really looking forward
to using all the data and creating a web interface to browse the information. Stay tuned�</p>

		<title>Run, Fatboy, Run</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/company/trevor-morris/2007/09/13/run-fatboy-run/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>David Schwimmer is at the helm in his theatrical directorial d�but, <a href="http://www.runfatboyrunmovie.com">Run,
Fatboy, Run</a>: a story of love and perseverance but with a heavy twist of humour. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Dennis,
the hapless protagonist yearning after his ex-fianc�e, who he left pregnant at the altar five years ago! Now a washed-up,
unfit (but not fat) security guard for a lingerie store, he is trying to win back the respect of his son and the love of his
life.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Simon Pegg and David Schwimmer have collaborated. They starred alongside one another in
the overlooked heist-gone-wrong comedy of confusion and betrayal, Big Nothing. I highly recommend both <a
href="http://www.bignothing.co.uk">Big Nothing</a> and Run, Fatboy, Run if you&#8217;re a fan of British humour and
sarcasm.</p>

sister to Paul Brewer. This time it was to celebrate the naming of their first son; James Christopher Brewer.</p>

<p>A good time was had by many and we all wish �Digger� all the best.</p>

		<title>Do You Speak in Typography?</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/company/trevor-morris/2007/08/28/do-you-speak-in-typography/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Typography is an absolute essential element in design</strong>.</p>

<p>Recently a few videos have surfaced which show off how important typography is. With little more than letters, the videos
have been able to enhance, visualise and articulate favourite songs or movie quotes in an exciting and engaging fashion.
Check out a few of my favourites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jarrattmoody.com/intonation.html">Say What Again</a> - an excerpt from Pulp Fiction (caution
contains explicit language)</li>
<li><a href="http://shadowplaystudio.com/smoking.html">Thank You For Smoking</a> - the opening credits for a movie</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=rIDdx7NPJgo">Ocean&#8217;s Eleven Project</a> - an excerpt from Ocean&#8217;s
Eleven</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=OoCHFQ1rVpE">Streetlight Manifesto</a> - an excerpt from a song</li>
<li><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=IEVvEsEbl5I">Duck and Cover</a> - from a 1950s public service announcement</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find other videos I&#8217;ve bookmarked on my <a
href="http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=901D6D71A639DA3B">Typography video playlist</a> on YouTube.</p>

		<title>BTCC at Donington</title>
		<link>https://creation.trovster.com/company/trevor-morris/2007/07/16/btcc-at-donington/</link>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>This weekend saw the sixth round of the <a href="http://www.btcc.net">British Touring Car Championship</a> at <a
href="http://www.donington-park.co.uk">Donington Park</a></p>

<p>Gordon Shedden in his Team Halfords Honda Civic won the first BTCC race of the day. However, Jason Plato driving for SEAT
Sport UK in a new-shape Leon dominated the second. Plato drove brilliantly in heavy rain on a track which was hazardous with
a lot standing surface water. He pulled away from the field and won comfortably in the second race of the day after passing
the first-race winner early on.</p>

<p>In the final race of the day, starting from ninth on the grid, Plato was some how able to quickly move through the field,
losing the lead briefly but managing to secure his second win of the day, and his fifth of the season. This meant he extended
his lead in the Championship over second place Fabrizio Giovanardi who had a poor weekend.</p>

<p>You can view some of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trovster/sets/72157600839710905/">photos I took from the
weekend</a></p>

<p>Finally, I would like to thank Steve for providing us with the passes for the weekend and for lending us an umbrella
which kept us from getting soaked!</p>
