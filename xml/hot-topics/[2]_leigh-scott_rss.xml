		<description><![CDATA[<p>This month I am mostly interested in art and Shakespeare. The Royal Academy&#8217;s annual <a
href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk">Summer Exhibition</a> on TV has inspired me to get back to my roots and get messy.
Then seeing the <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk" title="Royal Shakespeare Company">RSC</a> performance of <a
href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/newsandevents/events/5375.aspx">King Lear</a> reminds me of how much I love to watch
Shakespeare&#8217;s plays performed live on stage. <a href="http://www.staffordfestivalshakespeare.co.uk">Much Ado About
Nothing</a> is next, on an outdoor stage at Stafford Castle, always a treat. We are going on the last night to experience

Ducati 1098</a> is available now. A fantastic looking bike and perhaps another design classic from Ducati. It&#8217;s the
replacement for the &#8216;not so popular&#8217; 999 and to regain it&#8217;s appeal has similar features to the 916 range
of bikes produced between 1994 and 2002. I want one, but they ain&#8217;t cheap, especially the 1098 S Tricolore shown
below.</p>
