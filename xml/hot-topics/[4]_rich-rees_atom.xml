		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tim:</strong> Isn&#8217;t it typical, your TV breaking just before Christmas.<br />
<strong>Rich:</strong> Eh?<br />
<strong>Tim:</strong> You know, watching the portable TV from the bedroom.<br />
<strong>Rich:</strong> That <em>is</em> my TV.  </p>

<p>After suffering years of ridicule from Tim about my lounge TV I&#8217;ve celebrated with the purchase of a new one � a
32&#8221; LCD Samsung LE32R74. It&#8217;s beautifully designed, 1080i HD Ready with integrated Freeview and has fantastic
picture quality. Eye strain is now a thing of the past, so now all I&#8217;ve got to do is get a new car and Tim might give
me some peace�</p>]]></content>

		<title type="text">Power to the People</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve owned a hot hatch (Civic Type R). I sold it just before our daughter was born when I had a major attack of the
&#8216;Mr. Sensible Shoes&#8217;, and chopped it in for a 5 door diesel, which in hindsight wasn&#8217;t as smart as it
might sound. The Type R took us, fully loaded, to the South Coast and back quietly and rapidly; to IKEA to collect flat
packed wardrobes; to the refuse-site when I ripped out my old kitchen; to restaurants and pubs on Summer evenings, never
out-gunned by Boxters and BMWs, and on some of the best drives I&#8217;ve ever had. For me, the hot-hatch is the everyday
super-car, bringing performance and practicality to the masses. If I was in the market for another all-round super hero, it
would be the Focus ST � quick, spacious, capable and with a bullet proof 5 cylinder engine courtesy of Volvo, it ticks all
the boxes. I wonder if they come with baby-sick resistant seats�</p>]]></content>
