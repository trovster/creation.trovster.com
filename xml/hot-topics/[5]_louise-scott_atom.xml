		<title type="text">Tae Kwon Do Red Stripe</title>
		<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 10th May I successfully passed my grade for Red Stripe in Tae Kwon Do, as I get ever nearer to the Black Belt the
syllabus becomes more difficult and challenging.</p>

<p>I started the sport in December 2003 and joined my twin sister who decided to start again after taking a break to have
her children. I would like to take the opportunity to thank my instructor and other members of the club for all their
support. I hope to continue the sport for many years to come. Please visit the club website.</p>]]></content>
